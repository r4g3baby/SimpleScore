## Scoreboards (https://github.com/r4g3baby/SimpleScore/blob/main/src/main/resources/scoreboards.yml)
# This is where you create your scoreboards to be displayed.

# You can create a scoreboard by creating a node with the scoreboard name and
# then specifying a default "updateTime" and a list of "titles" and "scores".
#
# "updateTime": the default update time in ticks (optional and defaults to 20 ticks/1 second)
# "titles": text to display or a list of frames*
# "scores": the score number/value followed by the text to display or a list of frames* or a
#  map with the "conditions" (list of conditions) and "frames" (list of frames*) attributes
# *frames: is a list of strings or list of maps with the "text" (text to display) and
#  "time" (time to stay visible, optional and defaults to "updateTime") attributes
#
# Check out the examples bellow for more information.

# This is a simple scoreboard with only the top and bottom lines animated

  titles: '&7&LYour&6&lServer'
  scores:
